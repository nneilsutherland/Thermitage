# Thermitage

**Thermitage** is a research-oriented repository dedicated to advancing the integration of InfraRed Thermography (IRT) for 3D photogrammetric data fusion. In addition, this repository will provide benchmarking for the development of machine- and deep learning tools tailored to cultural heritage applications.

## 🔍 Core Objectives

- **IRT & Photogrammetry Integration (IRT-3DDF)**  
  Advance the field of InfraRed Thermography and 3D-data Fusion (IRT-3DDF).

- **IRT for Deep Learning Benchmarking**  
  Provide datasets for learning-based segmentation, defect detection, and temporal analyses.

- **Cultural Heritage Focus**  
  Enhance the principles and practices of IRT-3DDF for non-destructive testing techniques (NDT) within cultural and architectural heritage.

## 🛠 Features

- 🖼 **IRT Datasets:** A collection of Infrared Thermography datasets across sensors, cameras and platforms. This includes: (1) tandem sensors featured within the same thermal camera housing, thermal cameras of varying resolution, IR wavelengths and sensitivity; (2) complementary datasets coming from additional digital cameras, device screenshots or  advanced file formats; and (3) IRT coming from terrestrial (independent cameras or stereo set-ups) and aerial (UAV or fixed-wing aircraft) devices.
- 🧠 **IRT Benchmarking:** A comprehsnive collection of thermal infrared (TIR) images denoted for training \& validation of machine- and deep-learning models.  
- 📐 **IRT Processing Tools:** A collection of scripts and utilities for pre- and post-processing TIR images. This includes: (1) scripts designed to aid geometric and radiometric analysis of TIR images; (2) camera-specific scripts designed to work with specific functions and protocols; (3) a space for the development of additional tools through community-led projects.

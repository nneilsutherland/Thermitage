# Thermitage

**Thermitage** is a research-oriented repository dedicated to advancing the integration of InfraRed Thermography (IRT) for 3D photogrammetric data fusion. In addition, this repository will provide benchmarking for the development of machine- and deep learning tools tailored to cultural heritage applications.

This toolkit supports **multi-modal data fusion**, enabling precise thermal analysis and structural diagnostics of architectural heritage assets. Inspired by the principles in *InfraRed Thermography and 3D-Data Fusion for Architectural Heritage: A Scoping Review*, Thermitage bridges imaging science, heritage conservation, and AI.

## 🔍 Core Objectives

- **IRT & Photogrammetry Integration**  
  Advance the field of InfraRed Thermography 3D-data Fusion (IRT-3DDF).

- **Deep Learning Benchmarking**  
  Provide datasets for learning-based segmentation, defect detection, and temporal analyses.

- **Cultural Heritage Focus**  
  Enhance the principles and practices of IRT-3DDF for non-destructive testing techniques (NDT) within cultural and architectural heritage.
